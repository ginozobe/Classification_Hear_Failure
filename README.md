# Background
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worlwide.
Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs and this dataset contains 12 features that can be used to predict mortality by heart failure.
Most cardiovascular diseases can be prevented by addressing behavioural risk factors such as tobacco use, unhealthy diet and obesity, physical inactivity and harmful use of alcohol using population-wide strategies.
People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or already established disease) need early detection and management wherein a machine learning model can be of great help.

+ Anaemia : 0 means that the person does not have anaemia, if 1 it does.
+ Diabetes : 0 means that the person does not have diabetes, if 1 it does.
+ High_blood_pressure : 0 means that the person does not have high_blood_pressure, if 1 it does.
+ Smoking : 0 means that the person does not smoke, if 1 it smokes.
+ Sex : 0 for female, 1 for male.
+ Age: age of the patient [years]
+ Creatinine_phosphokinase: Level of the CPK enzyme in the blood (mcg/L)
+ Ejection_fraction: Percentage of blood leaving the heart at each contraction (percentage)
